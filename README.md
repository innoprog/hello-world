# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repo!

I am a 30 year old, 15+ year Web developer aspiring to learn some more useful and current technologies. I am looking to land an IT career, preferably involving some programming and editing as I have a keen eye for patterns and mistakes (it's a curse until it's not!).

I look forward to working with everyone!

Philip
